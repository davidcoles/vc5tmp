Temporary repo to test new api

BPF object file will be in repo to avoid need to do custom build process.

This should mean that the module can be used like any regular go module.

As the BPF is for a virtual architecture then is doesn't matter what platform the module is used on.

Includes bgp and monitoring cod for now for convenience.

NAT probably won't work on a tagged interface just yet?
